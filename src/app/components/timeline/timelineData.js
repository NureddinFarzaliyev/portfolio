          👨‍💻 My first acquaintance with the world of programming was in 2018,
          when I was 12 years old. I was very excited when I saw what can I do
          using just HTML itself. With a great excitement I've started to learn
          HTML, CSS then Javascript. Since that unforgettable day I'm eagerly
          following the trends and learning new things in web-development while
          improving myself as much as possible.

          🤯 Throughout these years I've learned a lot of things about
          web-development. I really loved it and already decided that this will
          be my future job. I was really enjoying creating different projects
          using HTML, CSS and Javascript. But I knew that I had to go beyond
          Vanilla JS. I knew that I'll be faced with an endless horizon.

        <p>
          😌 I've tried several new web-technologies and each time amazed by the
          things that lie beyond the horizon and things I can achieve using
          these vast amount of tools including Electron.js, Node.js, Express,
          MongoDB etc. which I've tried at that time.

          ⚛️ After trying out different technologies I've started to learn
          React.js in February 2023. I was amazed by the simplicity and the
          power of React. I've started to create different projects using
          React.js and I was really enjoying it. In order to understand React
          better I've built some projects which include Recipe App, Weather App,
          Movie App etc. You can see all of them on my GitHub profile.{" "}

        <p className="mt-2">
          🌊 It's worth mentioning that I've met with a beautiful tool -
          TailwindCSS in this period and started to build my apps using
          Tailwind.

        <p className="mt-2">
          🟢 Also, It was the first time that I've created a REST API for my
          website using Express.js which provides data about planet facts.

          😎 This period is probably one of the most productive periods of my
          life. I've created several MERN Stack Projects using Typescript,
          React.js, Express, Node.js and MongoDB including 'CinexploreAI',
          'Advanced Noteapp', 'Techquiz' etc. During this summer I dive deep in
          advanced concepts of Javascript and React.js and tried to learn best
          practices which is used in real-life projects. All these projects can
          be found on my GitHub page. You can also check out my YouTube channel
          to learn more about these projects.

            👨‍💻 In october, I've won a 4-months-long full-scholarship program for
            Frontend Course at the 'Matrix Academy' as a part of the project
            called 'Codecamp'. While participating at the project I've worked on
            real-life projects and improved my technical skills on Javascript &
            React as well as my soft-skills such as collaboration. It was a very
            valuable experience which contributed a lot to my self-improvement.
